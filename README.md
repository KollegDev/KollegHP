## How to submit your page(s)

Commit your page into the **development branch**.
Before you push your project we recommend that you use the Tailwind VSCode Plugin
[Headwind](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=heybourn.headwind) to format your code accordingly. It automatically sorts your classes and removes duplicates.

**Your push should contain:**

- English text only if not possible otherwise (Push description)
